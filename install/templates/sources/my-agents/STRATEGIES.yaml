# CAMI Agent Strategies
#
# This file defines the tech stack and behavioral strategies for agents in this source.
# agent-architect reads these strategies when creating new agents for this guild.
#
# IMPORTANT: These are GUIDANCE - agents discover actual tools at runtime and ask permission.
#
# Full documentation: https://github.com/lando-labs/cami/blob/main/docs/STRATEGIES.md

# ==============================================================================
# Tech Stack
# ==============================================================================
# Agents discover the ACTUAL stack from your codebase (package.json, etc.)
# Use this as a tiebreaker when multiple valid approaches exist.
#
# This file is OPTIONAL - if it doesn't exist or is empty, agent-architect will
# use its comprehensive fallback tech stack specifications.

tech_stack:
  # List the specific technologies your agents should specialize in.
  # Be concrete - list actual frameworks, languages, and tools with versions.
  # This guides CAMI and agent-architect when helping you build your agent roster.

  technologies:
    # Frontend
    - React 19+
    - Next.js 15+
    - TypeScript 5+
    - Tailwind CSS 4+

    # Backend
    - Node.js 20+
    - TypeScript 5+
    - PostgreSQL 15+
    - Drizzle ORM

    # Testing
    - Vitest
    - Playwright

    # Infrastructure
    - Docker 24+
    - GitHub Actions

    **Discovery Protocol**:
    Agents should DISCOVER actual tech stack by examining:
    - package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.
    - Existing code patterns and imports
    - CLAUDE.md technology sections
    - Build configurations

    **Use this tech stack as TIEBREAKER for**:
    - Modern vs legacy patterns (e.g., React Server Components vs client-side)
    - Multiple valid approaches (e.g., Server Actions vs API routes)
    - Library choices when creating new features

    **Respect Project Autonomy**:
    If project uses older versions, RESPECT existing choices unless user
    explicitly requests upgrade guidance. Never break working code for "newness".

    **Relationship with agent-architect's Tech Stack Guidance**:
    - This tech stack guides WHICH technologies to emphasize (your guild's focus)
    - agent-architect's tech stack specs ensure DEPTH of expertise (meta-level)
    - Together they ensure agents are both relevant AND expert

# ==============================================================================
# Documentation Strategy
# ==============================================================================
# Guides where agents create documentation files (ADRs, design docs, etc.)

documentation:
  # Default location for agent-generated documentation
  # Use project root to make docs easy to find, not scattered in subdirectories
  location: "<project-root>/reference/"

  # Examples:
  # ✅ Correct: /Users/username/my-project/reference/api-design.md
  # ❌ Wrong:   /Users/username/my-project/web/reference/api-design.md

  # Agents will mark AI-generated documentation with headers:
  # <!--
  # AI-Generated Documentation
  # Created by: [agent-name]
  # Date: YYYY-MM-DD
  # Purpose: [brief description]
  # -->
