# Reference Documentation

This directory contains **historical planning and design documents** that guided CAMI's development. These documents use "lando-agents" as example repository names since CAMI was originally developed at Lando Labs.

## Important Notes

- **These are planning documents, not user guides**
- Examples in these files (like `lando-agents`) are for illustration purposes
- The actual runtime code and user-facing documentation have been made source-agnostic
- CAMI works with any agent source repository, not just Lando's
