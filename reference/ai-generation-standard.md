# AI-Generated Documentation Standard

## Overview

This standard defines how AI agents should mark documentation files they generate or significantly modify. The purpose is transparency and maintainability while ensuring no code or configuration files are affected.

## Scope

### Files That MUST Be Marked

AI-generated file markings apply **ONLY** to:

- Markdown documentation files in the `reference/` directory (`.md` files)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Design documents
- Technical specifications
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Any human-readable documentation generated by AI agents

### Files That MUST NEVER Be Marked

AI-generated markings should **NEVER** be added to:

- Source code files (`.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.c`, `.cpp`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.env`, etc.)
- Build files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
- Shell scripts (`.sh`, `.bash`, `.fish`, etc.)
- Any executable or parseable code files
- `CLAUDE.md` (exempt as it contains agent instructions)
- `.claude/` directory contents (agent definitions and configurations)

## Format

### Standard Documentation Marker

Use an HTML comment block at the very top of the markdown file:

```markdown
<!--
AI-Generated Documentation
Created by: [agent-name]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Purpose: [Brief description of what this document covers]
-->
```

### Field Definitions

- **Created by**: The agent identifier (e.g., `agent-architect`, `api-documenter`, `code-reviewer`)
- **Date**: ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Purpose**: Single line describing the document's purpose (max 100 characters)

### Modification Tracking

If an AI agent significantly modifies an existing AI-generated document (>30% content change), add a modification record:

```markdown
<!--
AI-Generated Documentation
Created by: architect
Date: 2025-10-05
Purpose: System architecture overview

Last Modified by: security-reviewer
Modified Date: 2025-10-08
Modification: Added security architecture section
-->
```

## Examples

### Architecture Document

```markdown
<!--
AI-Generated Documentation
Created by: system-architect
Date: 2025-10-05
Purpose: Overview of microservices architecture and communication patterns
-->

# System Architecture

This document describes the overall architecture...
```

### API Documentation

```markdown
<!--
AI-Generated Documentation
Created by: api-documenter
Date: 2025-10-05
Purpose: REST API endpoint specifications for user management service
-->

# User Management API

## Overview

The User Management API provides...
```

### Design Document

```markdown
<!--
AI-Generated Documentation
Created by: feature-designer
Date: 2025-10-05
Purpose: Design specification for real-time notification system
-->

# Real-Time Notifications Design

## Problem Statement

Users need to receive instant notifications...
```

## Agent Responsibilities

### When Creating Documentation

1. **Check scope**: Verify the file is a markdown documentation file in an appropriate location
2. **Add marker**: Include the HTML comment block as the first line of the file
3. **Fill fields**: Provide accurate agent name, current date, and clear purpose
4. **Validate**: Ensure the marker doesn't interfere with markdown rendering

### When Modifying Documentation

1. **Check for existing marker**: Look for AI-generation marker at top of file
2. **If marker exists and changes are significant (>30%)**:
   - Add modification record to existing marker
   - Keep original creation metadata
3. **If marker doesn't exist**: Document is human-created, do not add marker unless completely regenerating

### When Creating Code or Config

1. **Never add markers**: Source code and configuration files must never receive AI-generation markers
2. **Use standard practices**: Follow language-specific commenting conventions for code attribution if needed
3. **Focus on code quality**: Let the code speak for itself

## Rationale

### Why Only Documentation?

- **Safety**: Documentation files can't break systems or builds
- **Transparency**: Helps humans understand document provenance
- **Maintainability**: Clear tracking of AI-generated vs human-created content
- **Non-intrusive**: HTML comments don't affect markdown rendering

### Why Not Code?

- **Risk of breakage**: Comments in code could introduce syntax errors
- **Unnecessary**: Code quality should be self-evident through reviews
- **Workflow interference**: May disrupt version control and diffs
- **Best practice**: Code attribution belongs in commit messages and PR descriptions

## Compliance

All AI agents operating in this development environment must:

1. Follow this standard exactly as written
2. Mark only documentation files as specified
3. Never mark source code or configuration files
4. Use the exact HTML comment format provided
5. Include all required fields in markers

## Version History

- **v1.0** (2025-10-05): Initial standard created by agent-architect
  - Corrected from overly broad initial specification
  - Narrowed scope to documentation files only
  - Removed code file marking completely
